High-Performance Java Cache Simulator

Overview: A sophisticated tool designed to simulate CPU cache hierarchy and analyze the impact of different replacement policies on Cache Hit Rates.

Architectural Features:
•	Replacement Algorithms: Full implementation of FIFO policy.
•	Configurable Parameters: Supports custom Cache Line Size, Capacity, and Associativity (Direct-Mapped, Fully Associative, and N-way Set Associative).
•	Memory Locality Analysis: Evaluates performance based on Temporal and Spatial Locality principles.

Why This Matters?
This project demonstrates a deep understanding of Computer Architecture and memory management, crucial for high-performance computing and systems engineering.
